This means we PASSED on the simulator and that the Code was run on Carla
The avi is of the simulator run <<< not sure how we passed...
The mp4 is of the test run on the site
The rosbag can be replayed: https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/3251f513-2f82-4d5d-88b6-9d646bbd9101

Go into Desktop and start terminator
  Open a terminal and into /home/workspace/ issue: wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/default.rviz
  This downloads the rviz config file
	From same terminal issue command: roscore
	Open a second terminal and issue command: rosbag play -l /path/to/your.bag
	Open a third terminal and issue command (or start from apps): rviz
	Configure rviz for this bag:
		File > Open Config or change this file: ~/.rviz/default.rvi to have Udacity file as default config

You should see the results...the -l makes the bag loop

Download Video locally to hear reviewer...we need a better classifier for site!
