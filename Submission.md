Taken from: https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/6047fe34-d93c-4f50-8336-b70ef10cb4b2/modules/e1a23b06-329a-4684-a717-ad476f0d8dff/lessons/462c933d-9f24-42d3-8bdc-a08a5fc866e4/concepts/3251f513-2f82-4d5d-88b6-9d646bbd9101

### How it works

Team member submissions are reviewed automatically and feedback is sent to the team lead.
Code is run on simiulator and if ok, taken to the test site to run
After that a ROSBAG is generated shared (active link for 20 days)
We review that and if ok, team lead can close the submission
We then go to next stage on the classroom to graduate!
